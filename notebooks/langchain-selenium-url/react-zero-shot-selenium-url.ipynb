Adding Kristin as an authorized user to the account was super quick and easy. She was able to call our provider on our behalf and talk to them about the degraded service. Afterwards our provider sent out a tech (for free) who replaced our router with a newer, better model, and he replaced a bunch of old connectors outside the home and in the attack to improve the service. He was also able to provide additional insight into some of the causes of our problems which lead us to getting a new network card for our computer. We have been dealing with frequent network drops and decreased speeds for so long, we became accustomed to it. Now it\\'s like the world around us is 10x faster, and it wouldn\\'t have happened if it wasn\\'t for imUp. Thank you!!\"\\n\\nMiranda H.\\n\\nAT&T\\n\\n\"This service is definitely an invaluable asset for making your internet provider accountable.
